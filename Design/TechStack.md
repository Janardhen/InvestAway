# Tech Stack
---
- [Backend: Dotnet C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
  - We will need to interact with the cheeta api. Accutech has bindings for this api in C# which makes it good backend to use.
- [Frontend: Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
  - Accutech has many production projects that use Vue for their frontend. They have many reusable components from those projects we can leverage. Using a different framework would pose difficulties.
- [Cheeta](https://www.trustasc.com/cheetah/)
  - Cheeta will handle all user authentication for our app therefore we need to interface with it.
- [Vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - Vscode will work well with the stack items we have chosen, it also has a consistent enviornment for configuration.
